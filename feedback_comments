Feedback Comments – Circles Hackathon Obstacles

1. Onboarding and Passkey Creation Issues

  One participant using a latest-generation iPhone was unable to create their profile due to a repeated “passkey creation failed” error.

  We could not identify the cause because there is no troubleshooting guide, no logs exposed to the user, and no explanation of potential failure modes.

  This blocked their onboarding entirely, which is a critical failure in the user journey.

2. Difficulty Finding the Circles Group Token Address

  The token address for the Circles group is not easily accessible.

  It requires navigating multiple pages or guessing the right link.

  A direct, clearly labeled “Token Address” field in the main interface or documentation would solve this instantly.

3. Non-Unique Usernames Create Confusion

  Users can choose any display name, and most assume they are selecting a unique one.

  Later, when searching for a user by name, dozens of identical names appear, making it almost impossible to identify the correct person.

  We strongly recommend implementing a unique username or handle (even if the display name remains flexible), ideally surfaced alongside the wallet address to improve clarity and prevent user-side errors.

4. Wrong Link in the App (Gnosis vs Metrí)

  In app.metri.xyz, the “send” flow contains a link pointing to app.gnosis.io, which breaks the expected continuity and confuses users.

  This link should redirect to the correct Metrí-native flow or be updated to the appropriate Gnosis action endpoint.

5. Confusing Entity Model (Person Avatars vs Group Avatars vs Wallets)

  The UI and documentation describe different entities (e.g., person avatar, group avatar) but these are not clearly linked to the wallet or to each other.

  Users cannot easily understand which entity represents the individual, the group, or the operational wallet.

  The conceptual model feels fragmented and cognitively exhausting. Clear diagrams or a unified explanation would help significantly.

6. Documentation Mentions “Contract Runner” Without Context

  The documentation refers to a “contract runner”, but there is no explanation of what it is, what its responsibilities are, why it appears, or how the user is expected to interact with it.
